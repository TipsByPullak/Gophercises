### Build instructions
1. In your terminal, navigate to directory "Problem 1" and type- `go build`
2. You will find a default quiz csv as "problems.csv". But if you want to use a custom csv file, use the -filename flag, by typing `./a -filename <your csv file name>` (Assuming you didn't use the -o flag during `go build` in step 2)
3. Follow the instructions and answer the questions accordingly.
